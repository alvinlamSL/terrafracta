- TODO List:
  - To add more "carriages" to the train
  - To change the GameMap tile structure to a hash map
  - To change the way tiles point to the previous / next
    tile
  - (DONE) To change fuel / energy representation from percentage
    to absolute values
  - Refueling / Re-energising stations should top up individual
    train components instead of just the train head
